					<h3>SPF ( Spruce Pine Fir)</h3>
					<p>The SPF lumber products, are processed together due to similar appearance and properties. SPF represents the largest reserve of commercial softwood in Canada.
					  SPF is the most commonly used lumber for house construction (known as &ldquo;2x4&rdquo;) in North America due to its strength, light weight and ease in cutting and nailing. Kiln-dried to a maximum 19% moisture content, SPF is used primarily for wall framing, roof framing, roof trusses, floor joists and beams. In addition, certain grades are suitable for non-structural applications such as packaging and re-manufacturing.<br />
					  Sizes: CLS SPF lumber is described by its nominal size, which differs from actual size.<br />
					
				  <strong>Thickness:</strong>&nbsp;1 inch and 2 inches (actual thickness is 19mm and 38mm).<br />
			      <strong>Width:</strong>&nbsp;From 3 inches to 12 inches (actual width is 63mm to 285mm).<br />
			      <strong>Length:</strong>&nbsp;Increments of two feet (0.6m), from 6 feet (1.8m) to 20 feet (6.0m). Packaged one length per bundle and wrapped for protection against moisture.<br />
			      <strong>Grades:</strong>&nbsp;All North American grades under the Canadian Lumber Standards are available. We also produce a Premium Export #2+Btr which is a highline appearance product (also known as J-Grade). ATI maintains a strict Quality Assurance Program for export grades.</p>
				  

<h3>Hemlock Fir </h3>
<p>Consists of two species: Hemlock and Pacific Silver Fir. Due to their similarities in appearance and composition, they are commonly logged, processed, and marketed under the collective reference Fir. Hemlock Fir is renowned for its fine texture, straight and even grain, and clear rings. In particular, the difference between its heartwood and sapwood is virtually indistinguishable. With color typically ranging from milky white to pale yellow, Hemlock Fir has exceptional utility in terms of mechanical processing.</p>
